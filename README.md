# Divvy Homework Assignment

This repository provides a starting point for a basic React + GraphQL application.
All of the configuration boilerplate is complete so you can start by writing the code that you want us to see.

Please **fork** this repo to your GitHub account.


## Project Setup

This repository is split into a web app directory (eg `/webapp`) and two server directories (eg `/webserver` and `/elixir`).

The `/webserver` one includes a functional GraphQL server in NodeJS with MongoDB backing it.

The `/elixir` one includes a functional GraphQL server in Elixir with Postgresql backing it.

Pick one or the other to use.

This project is intentionally not utilizing 3rd party services or create-react-app to give you the opportunity to showcase your talents wherever they are, be it the front end or the back end.

**Node** version **12** is the safest NodeJS release to use.  You can try version 14, but there can be node-gyp/python issues on OSX.
